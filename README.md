# OS-Scheduling

You have studied various scheduling algorithms and want to implement them but you need some assistance. Well you can use my code to help you understand various concepts.

You just need C# and MS Visual Studio if you want to edit the code, however, there is an *exe* file that you can just double-click on. Following scheduling algorithms are included:

- First come first serve
- Shortest job first
- Shortest remaining job first
- Priority Preemptive
- Priority Non-Preemptive
- Round Robin

Following are some of interesting features in this application:

- Very nice GUI
- Process stats in tabular form
- **Gantt-chart** of the simulation
- Switch between algorithms on same data set with one click
- List all the relevant stats
- Set priority's nature (lower or higher)

## Demonstration

This is the screen you'll see when you will run the application.

You can choose from various algorithms, as well as, set whther higher number corresponds to higher priority or not. As you fill the data for each process, table will start populating automatically. Finally click on "Run" to start the simulation.

## Note

This application was build for educational purposes, when I started learning C#. The is a puzzle (I know that and I am sorry) and I don't give guarantee that results are 100% accurate.
